The purpose of this project is to construct a clustering program with M groups (M will be defined by the user) based on the k-means algorithm. The program will load the file with the data, it will run the k-means algorithm with M centers and finally save the coordinates of the centers of the groups. The starting position of each center should be chosen randomly from the data. Also, at the end the error is calculated and printed as follows: for each instance x(i) we calculate the Euclidean distance ||xi-μk||^2 from the center μk of the group it belongs to, and we sum the distances for all examples x(i).
