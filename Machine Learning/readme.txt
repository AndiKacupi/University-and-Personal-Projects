The purpose of this project is to use some of the most common tools in the Artificial Intelligence field. Using a fashion dataset, we train an artificial neural network to recognize different types of clothes, we also deploy algorithms such as nearest neighbor, k means and na√Øve Bayes. By utilizing this algorithms, we cover supervised and unsupervised learning as the main ways an artificial system can use to learn.
