This is a selection of my personal JAVA projects that consists of games such as crazy eight, a card game very similar to the popular game UNO. I have also included a small project which simulates a banking system that creates and edits accounts, issues checks and makes all the basic actions that you would expect from a banking system. Another very interesting project is the Social Media Hub, a project that simulates in a very simplistic way how the social media applications are built. The Flight Simulation is another interesting project that simulates how flight companies develop applications that manage the customers and every flight.
